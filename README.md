# Refactor the Horiseon Website

Refactoring the index.html and style.css for Horiseon.  Added alt atributes to images.  Used semantic tags instead of divs with classes when applicable. And combined CSS attributes using semantic tags instead of classes when they became redundant.

Things that went well, commented out redundant lines before deleting them so I could view any changes side by side. Added a rel image and a Title (outside the scope of the project, but it made it easier to work on when I had multiple tabs open)
